# Changelog

All notable changes to `qalainau/filament-warp-scheduler` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-10-13

### Fixed

- Dropping an element whose `data-warp-scheduler-draggable` is a number, a string or a JSON array no longer fails on the
  server; the value is passed to `onExternalDrop()` as `['value' => ...]`.
- The README no longer mentions `->recordAttributes()`, which Filament 5 tables do not have, and explains how to escape
  the JSON in `extraAttributes()`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-13

### Added

- Canvas-rendered resource timeline for Filament 5 with day, week, month, quarter and year zoom, nested
  collapsible resource groups, vertical and horizontal virtualization and events loaded per block of resources.
- Resource day, week, day, month and list views and a Gantt chart, with a view switcher (`views()`).
- `SchedulerPage`, `SchedulerWidget` and the `InteractsWithScheduler` trait; `EventSource` for any number of
  event models; the `Schedulable` and `SchedulerResource` contracts.
- Drag and drop to move, copy (Alt) and resize events, range selection to create events, an unscheduled pool,
  Filament create, edit and delete actions, custom `eventActions()` in a context menu, keyboard editing and
  touch dragging. Changes are checked against read-only mode, locks and model policies on the server.
- Filters form, tenant scoping, display time zones with floating all-day dates, dark mode and SPA mode support.
- Recurring events (`recurring()`, `RecurrenceInput`) stored as RFC 5545 rules, expanded on the server, with
  this, following and all edit scopes.
- Business hours, availability and blocked time tables, capacity and conflict rules (`NoOverlap`,
  `WithinAvailability`, `NoBlockedTime`, `CustomRule`) that reject or warn, previewed while dragging.
- Utilization meters, group heatmaps and a histogram (`utilization()`).
- Work week, N-day, year, month agenda and multi-day resource views (grouped by resource or by date).
- Resource and event avatars (`resourceImage()`, `image()`), event variants (`variant()`), labelled blocked time,
  shift header rows (`shifts()`) and a side list to drag people onto slots or events (`sideList()`).
- A compact layout for narrow screens (`mobileView()`) and mirrored drawing for right-to-left languages (`rtl()`).
- Event hooks (`afterEventCreated()`, `afterEventMoved()`, `afterEventUpdated()`, `afterEventDeleted()`), browser
  `warp-scheduler:*` events, print orientation and date range (`printOptions()`) and monthly or yearly rules on the
  nth weekday, a day of the month or chosen months in `RecurrenceInput`.
- CSV and XLSX export (`exportable()`), .ics import (`icsImport()`), read-only events from a callback
  (`eventsUsing()`) and adding, editing and deleting resources on the board (`resourceSchema()`).
- Events assigned to several resources through a `belongsToMany` relationship (`resourcesRelationship()`) and
  reminders sent as database notifications (`reminders()`, `warp-scheduler:send-reminders`).
- Multi-select with Ctrl/Cmd + click and group dragging, copy, cut and paste, in-place renaming, event search,
  drops from any page element (`onExternalDrop()`), moving events between schedulers (`onAdopt()`) and booking
  unscheduled events into the first free slot.
- Event subtitles, icons and badges, server-rendered tooltips, a quick-info popup, resource descriptions, colors and
  extra columns, day cell content, holidays and loading placeholders.
- Slot duration, snap, slot width and height, scroll time, working and hidden days, visible hours (hidden time
  is squeezed out of the timeline), timeline header rows and per-view overrides (`viewSettings()`).
- Gantt dependencies with lag, critical path, baselines and progress; successors move along when a task is
  pushed later.
- iCal export and per-user subscription feeds (`icalFeed()`), printing and PDF.
- Two-way sync with Google Calendar and Microsoft Outlook (`calendarSync()`), with queued jobs, webhooks and
  the `warp-scheduler:sync-calendars` and `warp-scheduler:renew-calendar-watches` commands.
- English and Japanese translations, screen reader support and browser find for the events on screen.
